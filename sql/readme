dataset_v is a join between dataset and dataset_transform
data_persistence_v is directly pulled from data_persistence
schema_column_v

batch_group_v is directly pulled from dataset_collection
batch_group_members_v is directly based on dataset_collection_member

seed data is for testing and demo purposes

the extension is to decouple target destination persistence and provide for formal linking between datasets through transforms.

we are starting to deprecate batch groups to replace with collection groups in prep to add annotations that allow indexing and linking between the operational (current) layer of the data catalog with any business data cata log

we plan also to normalize the data_persistence piece as we currently overload the jdbc and file persistence objects to map to the same attributes.
